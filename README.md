Website_Registration_php
========================

  These are just basic php scripts for anyone who would like to implement a registration system into their website. Within this set of php scripts, you will be able to connect to a MySQL database schema in order for the php to verify the information that is put into the html forms that will be added to this repository later on. This php script set is to allow for people to implement a simple registration system without having to pay for a pricy system that can cost a big one time fee or a continuous monthly fee. When creating a MySQL database using SQL code or generating it within a MySQL webpage, you will be able to view information for the database such as the servername, and database. When you see this code in the script:

$mysql_server = '';
   $mysql_username = '';
   $mysql_password = '';
   $mysql_database = '';
   $mysql_table = '';
   
all you need to do is input the information from your MySQL account between the quotations you see in the above code snippet. The codes that are contained in this repository are just simple implementation of a member system for your website and more scripts are to be added soon.
